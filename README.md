# CountUp

Inspired by the numbers game of gameshow countdown

Given a target integer and an array of constants, is there a way to use elementary operations (+,-,*,/) to obtain the target? If so, find such method

Implemented is a brute-force search on binary trees modeling the computation

## Installation

To install, simply run:

```bash
make
```

after which the program is stored in ```/bin```


## Usage

The program is run by

```bash
countup <target> <constants...>
```

If a solution is found, then a computation tree obtaining it is output
